# Generic

It houses very high-level, far reaching styles. This layer is seldom modified, and is usually the same across any projects you work on. It contains things like Normalize.css, global box-sizing rules, CSS resets and so on. The Generic layer affects a lot of the DOM, hence it being nice and wide in the Triangle model, and occurring very early on.
